Personal notes on my journey to mastering Rust on Solana.

## Daily Notes

### 2nd April, 2024
1. Real TPS only 898/s lol
2. Looks too verbose
3. Sol playground’s simple contract interaction failed, test SOL amount really beta (only 5 SOL in 24hrs, one deployment costs 4.5 SOL).
4. PBFT: https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf 
5. Think of solana as an OS: accounts are files in linux
6. Solana’s executable accounts CAN initiate txns
7. Private keys for solana accounts?
